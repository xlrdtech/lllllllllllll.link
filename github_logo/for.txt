I am uploding the github logos to use as the root homepage favicon of my monorepo/portfolio. 
Each subfolder inside xlrdtech/lllllllllllll.link must have their own individual custom favicon because there all different websites that are being forwarded to custom url's from paid clients, business ventures, and personal projects. 
The root index.html is my professional portfolio showcase and all other index.html that are found in my repo are all indivual and seperate websites.
